Since the publication of this paper is still in progress, so is this repo. The repo will ultimately contain a folder for
1. Optogenetic experiments during behavioural task (Fig 1)
2. Electrophysiological experiments during behavioural task (Fig 2-4). 
3. Passive-viewing electrophysiology with optogenetics (Supplementary) 

Each folder will contain pre-processed data, analysis scripts and analysed data. Whenever relevant/suitable, the information will be sorted in subfolders for each figure in the paper.
